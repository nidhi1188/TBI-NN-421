		<h1>Nifti Viewer GUI Page</h1>
		<div>
			<span>
			<span>The purpose of this is to create a window that will open, allowing</span>
			<br>
			<span>the user to view Nifti images slice by slice. This is accomplished using</span>
			<br>
			<span>the nibable and matplotlib python modules to render and display</span>
			<br>
			<span>different elements.</span>
			<br>

			</span><br>
			<span>You will need Python 3.6 or later installed and added as a PATH variable</span>
			<br>
			<span>in order to run this viewer.</span>
			<br>
			<b>You will also need to install the following modules to run the niftiviewer</b>
            <br>
            <b>Module Requirements:</b>

                <li>nibabel</li>
                <li>matplotlib</li>
            </ul>
			<span>Once these are installed, you will be able to open the niftiviewer</span>
