		<h1>CSS Stylesheet Page</h1>
		<div>
			<span>The purpose of this is apply reoccurring styles to different</span>
			<br>
			<span>elements of the application. This can be seen in our buttons</span>
			<br>
			<span>as well as the different backgrounds throughout the program.</span>
			<br>
			<span>This coupled with our builder design pattern allows creation</span>
			<br>
			<span>of repeating elements easily.</span>
			<br><br>

			<span>Stylesheets being more widely accepted as industry practice over</span>
			<br>
			<span>inline CSS, our project will employ the same practice.</span>
			<br>
			<span>Just the same as we have used the style class in the past, we will</span>
			<br>
			<span>be able to accomplish styling using one line:</span>
			<br>
			<b> - obj.getStyleClass().add("style_defined_in_css_file");</b>
			<br><br>
			<span>This will also allow for easily switching between different themes</span>
			<br>
			<span>should we ever decide to make them</span>
